# Gmail Data Extraction

Golang script that uses the Gmail API to authenticate via OAuth 2.0, fetch all emails from a specified Gmail account (including sent and received), and export them to a structured JSON file. The script should handle pagination, rate limits, and extract key metadata (subject, sender, recipient, date, body text).

This is a fixed-price project that is well-defined. We are looking for a developer with specific experience in the Gmail API and OAuth 2.0 authentication.

Responsibilities:
- Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication for the Gmail API
- Develop a golang to fetch all emails from a Gmail account
- Handle pagination to retrieve the complete email history
- Extract and structure email data (subject, from, to, date, body)
- Export the data to a JSON file with a clear schema
- Handle rate limits and API errors gracefully
